Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools to the development and maintenance of high quality software systems. It involves the design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance of software products.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1.Development of programming language e.g Fortran and C 
2. Advent of structured programming in 1970 : It's characterized by modular code, top-down design, and stepwise refinement. It improved code quality, maintainability, and readability; laid the foundation of modern programming languages and software development.
3. Rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s : It enable more complex and flexible software systems; introduced iterative and incremental development, improving responsiveness to changing requirements.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Requirement : This involves gathering and documenting the user needs and system requirements.
2. Design: This involves creating high level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
3. Implementation: It involve writing of code and building the software according to the design specifications
4. Testing: It involve carrying out various tests to make sure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
5. Deployment: This is the stage at which the software created is release to users
6. Maintenance: It involves providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall involves sequential approach with distinct phases e.g requirements, design and implementation which flowing downwards like a waterfall. Example of scenario where waterfall will be appropriate include predictable project, regulated industries, safety critical systems and legacy system maintenance while agile is the iterative and incrementalapproach focused on flexibility, collaboration, and responding to change. Example of scenario where agile methodology will be appropriate include innovative project, large complex project and rapid prototyping.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer: They are the one responsible for coding and implementation of software solutions.
Quality assurance engineer: They ensure software quality by designing and executing test plans.
Project manager: They are responsible for overseen the planning , execution and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environment(IDEs): It provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging and testing code. Example include eclipse, intellij IDEA, and visual studio
Version Control System(VCS): This is the software tool for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members. Examples include subversion and Git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1. Changing requirements
2. Tight deadlines
3. Technical debt
Strategie to overcome the above challenges include effective communication, prioritization of tasks, agile methodologies, regular reassessment of project goals and timelines

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing: it help in testing individual components or modules of software.
Integration testing: Use in testing interaction between different components or subsystems.
System testing: Use in testing te entire software system as a whole.
Acceptance testing: Use in testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets users needs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the ability to craft questions or statements to get the best possible responses from artificial intelligence models.
Prompt engineering helps avoid vague question and getting confused answer by making our questions clear and specific so that AI can understand exactly what we need.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
 Example of vague prompt: Describe a historical event
 Improved prompt in a clear, specific and concise: Describe a historical event that happened in England in 1970
 The improved prompt is more effective because it give a more focused response and avoid getting a response that describe numerous historical events that happened in different country  at different year.
